## ⚡ The Ghost Workflow: How It Works

We’ve designed a seamless **3-Step Process** that takes you from desktop to full XP farming in minutes.

### 1. Launch & Assemble (Assisted Setup)
Stop manually typing code and dragging windows.
* **One-Click Launch:** Select your bot accounts and launch them all directly into the game from one menu.
* **Auto-Party System:** Once in the menu, the tool automatically reads Party IDs from your Hosts and forces your Client bots to join them. **No typing required.** Within seconds, your 5-man parties are formed and ready.

### 2. Configure Your Cycle
You decide exactly how the session runs before you start.
* **Set Your Target:** Choose how many matches to run (e.g., 5, 10, or unlimited).
* **Select Mode:** Pick your map/mode (e.g., HC Nuketown, HC Domination).
* **Press Start:** Hit **START"** and the automation takes over.

### 3. Fully Automated Grinding
Once you press start, Ghost handles the entire gameplay loop:
* **In-Game Protection:** Automatically selects loadouts and engages **Human-Like AFK** (Move/Stop/Crouch logic) to prevent kicks and bans.
* **The Loop:** Detects when the match ends, automatically backs out the host to the lobby if matches have finsihed.

## 🎮 Hybrid Control: Automation + Manual
We know things happen. That's why we give you total control when you need it.
* **Per-Bot Virtual Controller:** Need to change a setting, mute a player, or fix a loadout manually? Click any bot to open a **virtual Xbox controller**. You have full control over that specific instance without interrupting the others.
* **Live View:** See exactly what every bot sees in real-time.

## 🔥 Key Features for Sellers
* **Mass Scalability:** Run 10, 20, or 40+ bots on a single PC with our exclusive **Eco Mode** (drops background bots to 1 FPS).
* **Lobby Isolation:** Run multiple lobbies simultaneously. Lobby 1 can be in-game while Lobby 2 is setting up—they never interfere.
* **Anti-Detection:** Randomized AFK inputs make your bots look like real players taking a break, keeping your accounts safe.
